## Getting Started

1. Download **Airtime: Infinite** from the AppStore, or load to an iOS 13+ device directly with XCode
2. Transfer track files to the iOS device via:
	- USB connection using an [Apple Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK0W2AM/A/lightning-to-usb-3-camera-adapter)
		- **Note**: Phones and smaller Apple devices may display a "Low Power" warning and fail to connect. This can be fixed by connecting an external power source such as a power brick or mobile charger to the adapter.
		- It is recommended that files be [copied to the iOS device](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206481) prior to be loaded into the app. Tracks loaded direclty from the FlySight may experience slow load times and/or reload errors.
	- Direct FlySight microSD card download using a Lightning to microSD adapter.
		- **Warning**: Opening a FlySight or removing the microSD card incorrectly can cause permanent damage to the device. This method, though requiring the least amount of tools and adapters, is not recommended. 
	- Email, AirDrop, etc.
3. Open Airtime: Infinite and press the **+** button in the bottom corner to load a track. File system access may need to be granted at this time.
4. Resize the views as desired using the draggable handle between the chart and map view.
5. Interact with the data
	- Drag/zoom the chart to update both the chart view and map view visible region.
	- Touch a point on the chart to display the flight stats at that point on the top of the screen.
	- <img src="./Images/line-chart.png" alt="Chart" width="25" height="25"> - Press the line chart icon on the top right of the chart to select the data presented
	- <img src="./Images/ruler.png" alt="Ruler" width="25" height="25"> - Select the ruler icon to place the chart and data view into measurement mode. The point highlighted when measurement mode is activated is the base (represented by a blue vertical line). Tap the chart to show the difference between stats between the base and the selected point.
